## Welcome to MediTriage AI Pro

MediTriage AI Pro is your personal health companion designed to help you understand your symptoms and make informed decisions about seeking medical care. This guide explains how to use the patient portal to analyze symptoms, receive personalized care recommendations, and communicate effectively with healthcare providers.

The platform uses advanced artificial intelligence to provide you with accurate, evidence-based health information. While MediTriage AI Pro offers valuable insights, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical concerns.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Patient Portal

Visit the MediTriage AI Pro homepage and click on **"Patient Portal"** to access the symptom checker. The patient portal does not require account creation or login, allowing you to use the service immediately while maintaining your privacy. The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, guiding you through the symptom analysis process step by step.

### Language Selection

MediTriage AI Pro supports both English and Arabic languages. Use the language switcher in the top navigation bar to select your preferred language. The entire interface, including instructions and recommendations, will adapt to your chosen language.

## Using the Symptom Checker

### Describing Your Symptoms

The symptom checker begins with a text input field where you can describe what you are experiencing. Write in natural language as if you were speaking to a doctor. Include details about when symptoms started, how severe they are, what makes them better or worse, and any other relevant information. The more specific and detailed your description, the more accurate the analysis will be.

For example, instead of writing "headache," provide details like "severe throbbing headache on the right side of my head that started this morning, gets worse with bright lights, and is accompanied by nausea." This level of detail helps the AI understand your condition more accurately and provide better recommendations.

### Understanding Your Results

After submitting your symptoms, the system analyzes your input and provides a comprehensive assessment including several key components. The urgency level indicates how quickly you should seek medical attention, ranging from emergency (immediate care required) to routine (can wait for a scheduled appointment). The personalized care guide offers specific recommendations tailored to your symptoms, including when and where to seek care.

The doctor communication script helps you articulate your symptoms clearly when speaking with healthcare providers. This feature is particularly valuable if you feel nervous or unsure about how to describe your condition. The possible conditions section lists potential diagnoses that match your symptoms, helping you understand what might be causing your discomfort. Finally, the home care advice provides practical steps you can take to manage symptoms while waiting for medical care.

## Urgency Levels Explained

### Emergency

Emergency urgency indicates a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention. Call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency department right away. Do not drive yourself if symptoms are severe. Examples of emergency symptoms include chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness, sudden severe headache, or signs of stroke.

### Urgent

Urgent conditions require medical attention within a few hours but are not immediately life-threatening. Contact your doctor's office for a same-day appointment or visit an urgent care center. Do not wait more than 24 hours to seek care. Examples include high fever, severe pain, persistent vomiting, or symptoms that are rapidly worsening.

### Semi-Urgent

Semi-urgent conditions should be evaluated by a healthcare provider within one to three days. Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or appropriate specialist. Monitor your symptoms and seek care sooner if they worsen. Examples include mild to moderate pain, low-grade fever, or symptoms that have persisted for several days without improvement.

### Non-Urgent

Non-urgent conditions can be addressed at your next regular check-up or scheduled appointment within one to two weeks. These symptoms are not causing significant distress and are not worsening. Examples include minor aches, mild skin conditions, or questions about preventive health measures.

### Routine

Routine urgency indicates that your symptoms do not require immediate medical attention and can be discussed during your next scheduled visit or annual physical examination. These are typically minor concerns or questions about general health and wellness.

## Communicating with Your Doctor

### Using the Doctor Script

The doctor communication script provides a structured way to present your symptoms to healthcare providers. This script organizes your information logically, ensuring you don't forget important details during your appointment. Practice reading the script before your visit so you feel confident and prepared.

When meeting with your doctor, start by stating your main concern using the opening line from the script. Then provide the detailed symptom description, including timing, severity, and any factors that affect your symptoms. Mention any home treatments you have tried and whether they helped. Finally, ask any questions you have about your condition or treatment options.

### Preparing for Your Appointment

Before your medical appointment, write down all your symptoms even if they seem unrelated. Note when each symptom started and how it has changed over time. List all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Bring any relevant medical records or test results from previous visits. Consider bringing a family member or friend to help remember information and provide support.

## Home Care Advice

### Following Recommendations Safely

The home care advice section provides self-care strategies appropriate for your symptoms. Follow these recommendations carefully and monitor your condition for changes. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, seek medical attention promptly even if the initial urgency level was low.

Common home care measures include rest, hydration, over-the-counter pain relievers, and symptom-specific treatments. Always read medication labels carefully and follow dosing instructions. Do not exceed recommended doses. If you have questions about whether a medication is safe for you, consult a pharmacist or healthcare provider.

### When to Seek Additional Help

Even if your initial assessment indicated a lower urgency level, certain warning signs require immediate medical attention. Seek emergency care if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe bleeding, confusion, loss of consciousness, or symptoms of stroke. Contact your doctor if symptoms persist longer than expected, worsen despite home treatment, or if you develop new concerning symptoms.

## Understanding Possible Conditions

### Interpreting Diagnosis Suggestions

The possible conditions section lists medical conditions that could explain your symptoms based on the information you provided. These suggestions are educational and should not be considered a definitive diagnosis. Only a qualified healthcare provider can diagnose medical conditions after conducting a proper examination and appropriate tests.

Each condition listed represents a possibility based on symptom patterns recognized by the AI. Some conditions may be more likely than others, but the system cannot determine which specific condition you have without additional clinical information. Use these suggestions to inform your conversation with healthcare providers rather than as a final answer.

### Researching Your Symptoms

While it is natural to want to learn more about your symptoms, be cautious about information sources. Stick to reputable medical websites and resources rather than relying on social media or unverified sources. Remember that reading about symptoms online can sometimes cause unnecessary anxiety. Focus on the personalized recommendations provided by MediTriage AI Pro and discuss your concerns with healthcare professionals.

## Privacy and Data Security

### Your Information is Protected

MediTriage AI Pro takes your privacy seriously. The patient portal does not require account creation, and symptom information is processed securely without storing personally identifiable information. The system does not share your symptom data with third parties or use it for marketing purposes.

While the platform implements strong security measures, you should also take steps to protect your privacy. Avoid using public computers or shared devices to enter sensitive health information. Clear your browser history after using the symptom checker if you are on a shared device. Do not include personal identifying information like your full name, address, or identification numbers in symptom descriptions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is MediTriage AI Pro a replacement for seeing a doctor?

No, MediTriage AI Pro is a decision support tool designed to help you understand your symptoms and determine when to seek medical care. It does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with qualified healthcare providers for medical concerns.

### How accurate is the symptom analysis?

The system uses advanced AI trained on medical literature and clinical guidelines to provide evidence-based recommendations. However, accuracy depends on the quality and completeness of the information you provide. The AI cannot perform physical examinations or order diagnostic tests, which are often necessary for accurate diagnosis.

### What should I do if I disagree with the urgency level?

Trust your instincts about your health. If you feel your condition is more serious than the urgency level suggests, seek medical attention immediately. The system provides general guidance based on typical symptom patterns, but it cannot account for every individual circumstance or underlying health condition.

### Can I use this for children or elderly family members?

Yes, you can describe symptoms for family members of any age. When entering symptoms, specify the person's age and any relevant medical history. However, be especially cautious with children and elderly individuals, as they may have different symptom presentations and risk factors. When in doubt, err on the side of seeking professional medical evaluation.

### Is my information stored or shared?

The patient portal does not require account creation and does not store your symptom information long-term. Data is processed securely to generate recommendations and then discarded. The system does not share your information with third parties or use it for purposes other than providing you with symptom analysis.

## Emergency Contact Information

### When to Call Emergency Services

Call emergency services immediately (dial 911 in the US, 999 in the UK, 112 in the EU, or your local emergency number) if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain or pressure, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, sudden severe headache, sudden weakness or numbness especially on one side of the body, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, loss of consciousness or fainting, severe bleeding that won't stop, severe allergic reaction with swelling or difficulty breathing, or suicidal thoughts or intent to harm yourself or others.

### Poison Control

If you have ingested a potentially harmful substance, contact poison control immediately. In the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 to reach the national poison control hotline. Keep the substance container with you when you call so you can provide accurate information about what was ingested.

### Mental Health Crisis

If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or having thoughts of self-harm, contact a mental health crisis line immediately. In the United States, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Trained counselors are available 24/7 to provide support and connect you with local resources.

## Additional Resources

### Trusted Health Information Sources

For additional health information, consult reputable sources such as the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and World Health Organization (WHO). These organizations provide evidence-based health information written by medical professionals.

### Finding Healthcare Providers

If you do not have a regular healthcare provider, use the Care Locator feature (available through the clinician portal) or contact your local health department for referrals. Many communities offer low-cost or free clinics for individuals without insurance. Telehealth services are also increasingly available and can provide convenient access to medical care.
