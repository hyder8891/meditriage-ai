# User Feedback: Poor Visualizations and Images

## Issue Reported
User reports that the homepage has:
- Poor visualizations
- Poor quality images
- No animations

## Current State Analysis
Looking at the screenshot provided:
1. Background has medical-themed graphics but they appear blurry/low quality
2. The hero section has a mockup image on the right side showing some kind of medical dashboard
3. Statistics cards (60s, 95%, 40%) are present but static
4. Overall design lacks motion/animation to engage users
5. Navigation has numbered badges (2, 3, 4, 5) which seem out of place
6. Arabic language toggle button present

## Required Improvements
1. Replace low-quality background images with high-resolution medical imagery
2. Add smooth animations for hero section entrance
3. Animate statistics counters (count-up effect)
4. Add hover effects and micro-interactions
5. Improve mockup/dashboard images with higher quality versions
6. Add parallax scrolling or other engaging motion effects
7. Remove or fix the numbered badges in navigation
8. Ensure all images are optimized but high-quality
